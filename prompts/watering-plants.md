You and your friend are watering plants together. The plants are planted in a row and each of them needs a specific amount of water. To be efficient and accurate, your friend and you establishes the following rules:
- You water your plants from left to right and your friend waters their plants from right to left
- If you don’t have enough water, you want to refill your water before you water the plants
- Unfortunately, the water faucet requires two people to operate, thus you and your friend go refill water together whenever one of you needs to refill
    - This counts as 1 refill
- You move onto the plants together
    - E.g. when you’re watering your first plant, your friend is watering their first plant

How many times will you and your friend need to refill your water?
